I am a passionate and results-driven Software Developer & DevOps Engineer with a strong interest in building a clean and maintainable codebase. With hands-on experience across the full development lifecycle, from planning and design to implementation and deployment, I specialize in developing clean performant code and automating robust infrastructure workflows. I thrive at the intersection of software engineering and DevOps practices, where I can streamline processes, improve reliability, and accelerate delivery cycles. I’m always seeking new opportunities to impact meaningful projects, work with talented teams, and continue growing at the forefront of technology.
